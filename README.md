# electron-syphon

Experimental native Node.js module for Syphon.

Currently focused on Electron, specifically.

## Install

```bash
yarn
```

## Run

```bash
yarn start
```

> ⚠️ A Syphon client must be running before starting Electron.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

> ⚠️ Syphon.framework must exist in `/Library/Frameworks/` before building. Once built, it is packaged into the Electron application and can be removed from `/Library/Frameworks/`
